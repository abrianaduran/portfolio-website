      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="group">
      <div class="item">
        <p>At seventeen years old, I remember picking up my first book on computer programming and feeling so inspired when I first printed the words that every coder knows: "Hello World!" It is now seven years later and my passion is still unfaded, and in fact growing. As new technology emerges, that passion forges new curiosity that drives me to always continue learning! </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p>When like-minded individuals work together, great things are accomplished, and this is especially true for web development. That's why I want to be part of a team who can solve problems by bringing our individual skills to the table and by sharing those skills. Together, a passionate team can create functionality and style to websites used across the globe.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p>Though coding is where I spend a large part of my day, I also try to find the time to spend exercising, discovering new music, and watching and analyzing films. </p>

      <div class="item">
        <p>As a fullstack web developer, my skillset includes coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>
